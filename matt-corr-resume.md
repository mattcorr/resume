# Matthew Corr - Senior Consultant

Throughout his career, Matt has demonstrated a high level of proficiency in two roles: Developer and DevOps Engineer.  
As a developer, Matt has extensive experience building Microsoft Integration solutions utilising BizTalk Server and Service Fabric. He is well known for his methodical approach and for his excellent documentation and diagrams.  

As a DevOps Engineer, Matt is passionate about delivering successful outcomes through his expert implementation of DevOps processes and automation. While highly skilled and knowledgeable in Microsoft technologies such as PowerShell and Azure DevOps, he is equally proficient in leveraging industry-standard tools like Octopus Deploy and TeamCity.  

Matt has worked with non-Microsoft environments and tools such as AWS, Bamboo, Jenkins, OpenShift and Terraform. This has provided him with broader experience across the industry as a whole.

In general, Matt has repeatedly shown high levels of experience with the build, deployment and testing of different integration applications across various types of client environments. He is continually sought after as an SME in all aspects of DevOps, both within Deloitte and by our clients.
